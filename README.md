## Laravel's Documentation has Moved

Previously, the documentation for the Laravel PHP framework was stored in this repository. It is now stored in the main Laravel framework repository.

The new documentation can be found [here in the Laravel PHP framework Repository](http://github.com/laravel/laravel/tree/master/laravel/documentation).

Please submit any pull-requests and issues for the documentation to the main Laravel PHP framework repository.

### Why was the documentation moved into the main repository?

It has been done to hasten and ease core development and community participation.

Both the documentation and unit-tests for the framework are being moved into the main repository partly to ease the core team's job of keeping them up to date. But, also to reduce the necessary effort of community members who submit pull-requests with enhanced or altered functionality. A single pull-request will now be sufficient to update the core code, tests, and documentation.
